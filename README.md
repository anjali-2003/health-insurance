# Medical Insurance Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is a medical insurance price prediction system that utilizes machine learning to estimate the cost of insurance based on various user inputs. The model takes into account factors such as age, diabetic status, previous heart disease, and other relevant information to provide an accurate prediction of the insurance amount.

## Features

The system incorporates the following key features:

1. **Age**: The age of the user, as it is a significant factor in determining insurance premiums.

2. **Diabetic Status**: Whether the user is diabetic or not, as this medical condition can impact insurance costs.

3. **Previous Heart Disease**: A binary indicator of whether the user has a history of heart disease, which is a critical factor in insurance pricing.

4. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: The BMI of the user, providing insight into their overall health and potential insurance risk.

5. **Smoking Status**: Whether the user is a smoker or non-smoker, as smoking habits often influence insurance rates.

6. **Number of Dependents**: The number of dependents covered by the insurance policy.

## Usage

To use the Medical Insurance Price Prediction system, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Input Data**: Run the system and provide the necessary input data when prompted. Input the user's age, diabetic status, previous heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and the number of dependents.

3. **Prediction**: The system will process the input data and provide a predicted insurance amount based on the trained machine learning model.

## Model Training

The model has been trained using a dataset that includes historical insurance data with corresponding user characteristics. The training process involves the optimization of model parameters to achieve accurate predictions. If you wish to retrain the model with new data, you can use the provided training script:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_path path/to/training_data.csv --output_model_path path/to/save/model.pkl
```
